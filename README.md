# Course Number
ComS 252 - Linux Operating System Essentials

# Class Overview
ComS 252 was a class based entirely around Linux such as getting familiar with Linux, specificaly Fedora, bash commands, and more. Importantly, all homework assignments were doing using VirtualBox (see the [Notes Section](#notes) below for more information). The class covered from history of Linux, such as various distros, all the way to some fairly complicated setups, commands, etc. within Linux.

# Year Taken
Junior Year - Semester 1

# Grade Received
* Overall Class Grade: A
* Homework Grades (11): All A's

# Goal of the Assignments
The assignments ranged significantly in difficulty as they started at simply building a custom Linux VM (a starting .iso was given) all the way to creating a router using two interfaces, a server and a client. For the early on assignments, many instructions were given as a sort of guide, but the instructions became more scarce as the assignments got more difficult, to further encourage learning.

# Notes
Due to the course relying on VirtualBox for all assignments, I did not upload any of the Virtual Disk Image (.vdi) files for privacy reasons (may contain sensitive log-in information) and due to the massive file size required use of Git LFS. I did, however, upload all .pdf files related to each homework (the specifications) so you can see what all would have been done.
